# Bookstore Database


## Business problem
Design a functional database for using in a generic online bookstore.

## Solution strategy
- Identify data sources
- Draw database
- Create tables that store data from sources
- Define relationships between tables
- Propose Machine Learning problems that could be solved through queries on database

## Tools
The tools used to run this database are:
- Draw SQL
- Postgresql

## Database Draw
Here is the drawing of the database with tables relationships:

## Available information
Using SQL queries is possible to answer these and much more questions:
- Which are the most sold books?
- Which book category sells the most?
- How much is the monthly revenue of the bookstore?
- How much is the profit of the book store?
- How many books are in stock?
- Which publisher sells the most?
- Who is our main supplier?
- Given a period of time, are the sales growing?
- Which category is our clients interested the most?
- Which is the main payment option?

## Kinds of Machine Learning Algorithms That could be applied
The following machine learning problems can be solved using this database:
- Classification
- Regression
- Association
- Clustering
- Time Series

## Next Steps
- Perform some testing to database
- Find data to populate tables and perform a machine learning study
- Implement in local server to perform more testing
